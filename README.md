# Demo-Weather-App
This is a portfolio project to showcase dagger implementation along with Room, Retrofit, MVVM and LiveData. This project simply fetches weather data from different locations based on user selection. It also can detect current location's weather information. I have used Kotlin as primary language and Clean architecture for better readability.
